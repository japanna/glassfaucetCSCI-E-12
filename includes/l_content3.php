        <p class="text" id="italic">"I want my glass to stop conversations, and then provoke long discussions."</p>
        <p class="text">For 20 years, Jim McKelvey has worked to capture the magic of glass in his art. As chairman of the world's largest gathering of glass artists in 2006, he surprised and challenged other artists with his innovative glass faucets.</p>
        <p class="text">Creating functional art is a great challenge for an artist/engineer. Each of McKelvey's faucets is shaped by hand from a tube of molten glass. For every four attempts, only one faucet is accepted.</p> 
        <p>To achieve the ultimate in brilliance and durability, each faucet is cut, polished, tempered, and assembled using materials so pure that the FDA approves them for implantation into the body. This patented design is like nothing else in the world.</p>
        <p class="text">McKelvey began blowing glass as an undergraduate engineer at Washington University Saint Louis in 1986. McKelvey is a popular speaker and the co-founder of <a href="http://www.stlglass.com" target="_blank" title="Third Degree Glass Factory">Third Degree Glass Factory</a> and <a href="http://www.square.com" target="_blank" title="Square Inc.">Square Inc.</a></p>

<h2>About the faucets </h2>
<p>Each faucet is hand-made by Jim McKelvey and his team of skilled glassblowers. No two are exactly alike and yearly production is limited to a few hundred pieces. </p>
<p>Since each piece of glass we create is unique, we do not have stock items. Instead, our current inventory is displayed on this website. Pick your favorite; there will never be another one like it. </p>
<p>Fully tempered and guaranteed against breakage, the spouts come in two basic styles, single-twist and double-twist. Double-twists typically have a lower spout height to fit undermount sinks.</p> 
<p id="gallery_text">In addition to our seven standard shades, we have over 200 custom shades of glass. If you desire a special color or shape, please <a href="contact.php">contact us.</a> We like a challenge. </p>
